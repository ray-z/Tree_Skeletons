# Tree_Skeletons

##Abstract
We present a probabilistic approach for automatically generating 
three-dimensional (3D) tree skeletons from videos. The system generates a 3D 
skeleton from a two-dimensional (2D) skeleton which is created based on 
information collecting from the input video. Our approach combines global and 
local constrains to ensure an optimal 3D structure. Further more, Von Mises 
distribution is used while generating new 3D skeletons from initial model. This 
means users could create potentially infinite similar but not identical 3D 
skeletons based on the initial video.
